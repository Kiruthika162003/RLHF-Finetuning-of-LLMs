# Project Title

## Problem Statement
I aim to develop a model that can effectively summarize text using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The goal is to improve the quality of generated summaries by training the model to prefer human-like responses.

## Steps Done
1. **Install Dependencies**: I installed the necessary libraries and tools for the project.
2. **Load Dataset**: The dataset was loaded and preprocessed.
3. **Train Model**: The model was trained using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning.
4. **Evaluate Model**: The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics.
5. **Save Model**: The trained model was saved for future use.

## How It Works
The model uses a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to generate high-quality text summaries. Initially, the model is trained using supervised learning on a preprocessed dataset. Then, human feedback is used to further fine-tune the model using reinforcement learning techniques. This helps the model learn to generate summaries that are more aligned with human preferences.

## How the Code Works
1. **Data Collection**: I collected a dataset of text summaries with human feedback.
2. **Preprocessing**: The data was cleaned and tokenized to prepare it for training.
3. **Supervised Fine-Tuning**: The model was initially trained using supervised learning on the preprocessed dataset.
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Human feedback was used to further fine-tune the model using reinforcement learning techniques.
5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics to ensure it met the desired quality standards.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of text summaries with human feedback. It includes both the original text and the corresponding human-generated summaries. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to ensure the model's performance could be accurately evaluated.
